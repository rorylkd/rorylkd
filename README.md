### Hi!

- Here's a link to my portfolio! (I'm hoping to dazzle you all with color 🦚): [Portfolio](https://rorylkd.github.io/Portfolio2.0/) 
- I'm currently working my way through the UWA Full-stack developer bootcamp. I honestly can't believe it took me this long to start coding...it's pretty neat. Hoping to live a long long life and cram a whole bunch of information into my skull while I'm doing it. Starting with node.js! I'm in love ❤️
